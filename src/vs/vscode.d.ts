	 * can be executed [manually](#commands.executeCommand) or from a UI gesture. Those are:

	 * the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

	 * for your extension.
	 *
	 * Commands from other extensions and from the editor itself are accessible to an extension. However,
	 * when invoking an editor command not all argument types are supported.
	 *
	 * This is a sample that registers a command handler and adds an entry for that command to the palette. First
	 * register a command handler with the identifier `extension.sayHello`.
	 * ```javascript
	 * commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () => {
	 * 	window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');
	 * });
	 * ```
	 * Second, bind the command identifier to a title under which it will show in the palette (`package.json`).
	 * ```json
	 * {
	 * 	"contributes": {
	 * 		"commands": [{
	 * 			"command": "extension.sayHello",

	 * Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),

	 *
	 * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a [TextDocument](#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a [document selector](#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex [filter](#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a [score](#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](#languages.registerHoverProvider),
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

		 *  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesn’t match, the result is `0`
