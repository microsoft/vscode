		 *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
		 *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
		 *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
		 *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
		 *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How to encode tokens
		 *
		 * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
		 * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
		 * ```
		 *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
		 *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
		 * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
		 * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
		 * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
		 * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
		 * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
		 * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
		 * ```
		 *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @see [SemanticTokensBuilder](#SemanticTokensBuilder) for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
		 * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until VS Code decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
		 */
		provideDocumentSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>;

		/**
		 * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
		 * this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How tokens change when the document changes
		 *
		 * Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
		 *
		 *    edit: { start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
		 * *NOTE*: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.

	/**
	 * Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
	 * like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
	 *
	 * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a [TextDocument](#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a [document selector](#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex [filter](#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a [score](#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](#languages.registerHoverProvider),
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

		 * A match is computed according to these rules:

		 * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter), so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
		 * 3. A [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter) will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
		 *  1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
		 *  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesn’t match, the result is `0`
		 *  3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
		 *  4. The result is the maximum value of each match
		 *
		 * Samples:
		 * ```js
		 * // default document from disk (file-scheme)
		 * doc.uri; //'file:///my/file.js'
		 * doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
		 * match('javascript', doc); // 10;
