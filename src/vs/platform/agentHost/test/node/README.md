# Agent Host node tests

Choose the lowest test type that exercises the behavior:

- `*.test.ts`: in-process unit tests for one service, mapper, reducer, or provider component.
- `protocol/`: a real Agent Host server driven over AHP with `ScriptedMockAgent`. Use for server and protocol contracts that do not depend on a provider SDK.
- `e2e/providers/`: the whole server and bundled provider process with deterministic LLM captures and AHP snapshots. Use when provider behavior is part of the contract.
- `providerIntegration/`: a real provider process backed by the local mock LLM. Use when provider lifecycle matters but realistic model behavior does not.
- Other `*.integrationTest.ts` files at this level: focused component integrations that do not exercise AHP end to end, such as direct SDK or Git-service coverage.

The protocol and E2E folders contain their own running and authoring instructions.
