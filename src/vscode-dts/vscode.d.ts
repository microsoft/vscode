		/**
		 * Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to
		 * the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
		 *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
		 *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
		 *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
		 *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
		 *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How to encode tokens
		 *
		 * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
		 * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
		 * ```
		 *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
		 *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
		 * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
		 * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
		 * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
		 * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
		 * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
		 * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
		 * ```
		 *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @see {@link SemanticTokensBuilder} for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
		 * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until the editor decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
		 */
		provideDocumentSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>;

		/**
		 * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
		 * this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How tokens change when the document changes
		 *
		 * Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:

		 * uri to the same resource on the client machine.
		 *
		 * This is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine.
		 *
		 * If the extension is running remotely, this function automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel
		 * from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local uri to the tunnel. The lifetime of
		 * the port forwarding tunnel is managed by the editor and the tunnel can be closed by the user.
		 *
		 * *Note* that uris passed through `openExternal` are automatically resolved and you should not call `asExternalUri` on them.
		 *
		 * #### `vscode.env.uriScheme`
		 *
		 * Creates a uri that - if opened in a browser (e.g. via `openExternal`) - will result in a registered {@link UriHandler}
		 * to trigger.
		 *
		 * Extensions should not make any assumptions about the resulting uri and should not alter it in any way.
		 * Rather, extensions can e.g. use this uri in an authentication flow, by adding the uri as callback query
		 * argument to the server to authenticate to.
		 *
		 * *Note* that if the server decides to add additional query parameters to the uri (e.g. a token or secret), it
		 * will appear in the uri that is passed to the {@link UriHandler}.
		 *
		 * **Example** of an authentication flow:
		 * ```typescript
		 * vscode.window.registerUriHandler({
		 *   handleUri(uri: vscode.Uri): vscode.ProviderResult<void> {
		 *     if (uri.path === '/did-authenticate') {
		 *       console.log(uri.toString());

		 * });
		 *
		 * const callableUri = await vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(vscode.env.uriScheme + '://my.extension/did-authenticate'));
		 * await vscode.env.openExternal(callableUri);
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note* that extensions should not cache the result of `asExternalUri` as the resolved uri may become invalid due to
		 * a system or user action — for example, in remote cases, a user may close a port forwarding tunnel that was opened by
		 * `asExternalUri`.
		 *
		 * #### Any other scheme
		 *
		 * Any other scheme will be handled as if the provided URI is a workspace URI. In that case, the method will return
		 * a URI which, when handled, will make the editor open the workspace.
		 *
		 * @return A uri that can be used on the client machine.

		 *
		 * **Note:** in some cases calling this method may result in the currently executing extensions (including the

		 *
		 * Use the {@linkcode onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders()} event to get notified when the

		 * ```typescript
		 * workspace.updateWorkspaceFolders(workspace.workspaceFolders ? workspace.workspaceFolders.length : 0, null, { uri: ...});
		 * ```

		/**
		 * Creates a file system watcher that is notified on file events (create, change, delete)
		 * depending on the parameters provided.
		 *
		 * By default, all opened {@link workspace.workspaceFolders workspace folders} will be watched
		 * for file changes recursively.
		 *
		 * Additional paths can be added for file watching by providing a {@link RelativePattern} with
		 * a `base` path to watch. If the `pattern` is complex (e.g. contains `**` or path segments),
		 * the path will be watched recursively and otherwise will be watched non-recursively (i.e. only
		 * changes to the first level of the path will be reported).
		 *
		 * *Note* that requests for recursive file watchers for a `base` path that is inside the opened
		 * workspace are ignored given all opened {@link workspace.workspaceFolders workspace folders} are
		 * watched for file changes recursively by default. Non-recursive file watchers however are always
		 * supported, even inside the opened workspace because they allow to bypass the configured settings
		 * for excludes (`files.watcherExclude`). If you need to watch in a location that is typically
		 * excluded (for example `node_modules` or `.git` folder), then you can use a non-recursive watcher
		 * in the workspace for this purpose.
		 *
		 * If possible, keep the use of recursive watchers to a minimum because recursive file watching
		 * is quite resource intense.
		 *
		 * Providing a `string` as `globPattern` acts as convenience method for watching file events in
		 * all opened workspace folders. It cannot be used to add more folders for file watching, nor will
		 * it report any file events from folders that are not part of the opened workspace folders.
		 *
		 * Optionally, flags to ignore certain kinds of events can be provided.
		 *
		 * To stop listening to events the watcher must be disposed.
		 *
		 * *Note* that file events from recursive file watchers may be excluded based on user configuration.
		 * The setting `files.watcherExclude` helps to reduce the overhead of file events from folders
		 * that are known to produce many file changes at once (such as `node_modules` folders). As such,
		 * it is highly recommended to watch with simple patterns that do not require recursive watchers
		 * where the exclude settings are ignored and you have full control over the events.
		 *
		 * *Note* that symbolic links are not automatically followed for file watching unless the path to
		 * watch itself is a symbolic link.
		 *
		 * *Note* that file changes for the path to be watched may not be delivered when the path itself
		 * changes. For example, when watching a path `/Users/somename/Desktop` and the path itself is
		 * being deleted, the watcher may not report an event and may not work anymore from that moment on.
		 * The underlying behaviour depends on the path that is provided for watching:
		 * * if the path is within any of the workspace folders, deletions are tracked and reported unless
		 *   excluded via `files.watcherExclude` setting
		 * * if the path is equal to any of the workspace folders, deletions are not tracked
		 * * if the path is outside of any of the workspace folders, deletions are not tracked
		 *
		 * If you are interested in being notified when the watched path itself is being deleted, you have
		 * to watch it's parent folder. Make sure to use a simple `pattern` (such as putting the name of the
		 * folder) to not accidentally watch all sibling folders recursively.
		 *
		 * *Note* that the file paths that are reported for having changed may have a different path casing
		 * compared to the actual casing on disk on case-insensitive platforms (typically macOS and Windows
		 * but not Linux). We allow a user to open a workspace folder with any desired path casing and try
		 * to preserve that. This means:
		 * * if the path is within any of the workspace folders, the path will match the casing of the
		 *   workspace folder up to that portion of the path and match the casing on disk for children
		 * * if the path is outside of any of the workspace folders, the casing will match the case of the
		 *   path that was provided for watching
		 * In the same way, symbolic links are preserved, i.e. the file event will report the path of the
		 * symbolic link as it was provided for watching and not the target.
		 *
		 * ### Examples
		 *
		 * The basic anatomy of a file watcher is as follows:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * const watcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(<folder>, <pattern>));
		 *
		 * watcher.onDidChange(uri => { ... }); // listen to files being changed
		 * watcher.onDidCreate(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders being created
		 * watcher.onDidDelete(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders getting deleted
		 *
		 * watcher.dispose(); // dispose after usage
		 * ```
		 *
		 * #### Workspace file watching
		 *
		 * If you only care about file events in a specific workspace folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0], '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * If you want to monitor file events across all opened workspace folders:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**​/*.js');
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note:* the array of workspace folders can be empty if no workspace is opened (empty window).
		 *
		 * #### Out of workspace file watching
		 *
		 * To watch a folder for changes to *.js files outside the workspace (non recursively), pass in a `Uri` to such
		 * a folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * And use a complex glob pattern to watch recursively:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Here is an example for watching the active editor for file changes:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, '*'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @param globPattern A {@link GlobPattern glob pattern} that controls which file events the watcher should report.
		 * @param ignoreCreateEvents Ignore when files have been created.
		 * @param ignoreChangeEvents Ignore when files have been changed.
		 * @param ignoreDeleteEvents Ignore when files have been deleted.
		 * @return A new file system watcher instance. Must be disposed when no longer needed.

	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function

	 *

	 * a selector will result in a {@link languages.match score} that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like {@link languages.registerHoverProvider hover},
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like {@link languages.registerCompletionItemProvider IntelliSense} the

		 * Compute the match between a document {@link DocumentSelector selector} and a document. Values
		 * greater than zero mean the selector matches the document.
		 *
		 * A match is computed according to these rules:
		 * 1. When {@linkcode DocumentSelector} is an array, compute the match for each contained `DocumentFilter` or language identifier and take the maximum value.
		 * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a {@linkcode DocumentFilter}, so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
		 * 3. A {@linkcode DocumentFilter} will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
		 *    1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
		 *    2. When `scheme`, `language`, `pattern`, or `notebook` are defined but one doesn't match, the result is `0`
		 *    3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
		 *    4. The result is the maximum value of each match
		 *

		 * ```js
		 * // default document from disk (file-scheme)
		 * doc.uri; //'file:///my/file.js'
		 * doc.languageId; // 'javascript'

		 * match('*', doc); // 5
		 * match('fooLang', doc); // 0
		 * match(['fooLang', '*'], doc); // 5
		 *
		 * // virtual document, e.g. from git-index
		 * doc.uri; // 'git:/my/file.js'
		 * doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
		 * match('javascript', doc); // 10;
