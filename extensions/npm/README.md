# Node npm

**Notice:** This extension is bundled with Visual Studio Code. It can be disabled but not uninstalled.

## Features

### Task Running

This extension supports running npm scripts defined in the `package.json` as [tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks). Scripts with the name 'build', 'compile', or 'watch'
are treated as build tasks.

To run scripts as tasks, use the **Tasks** menu.

For more information about auto detection of Tasks, see the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks#_task-autodetection).

### Script Explorer

The Npm Script Explorer shows the npm scripts found in your workspace. The explorer view is enabled by the setting `npm.enableScriptExplorer`. A script can be opened, run, or debug from the explorer.

### Run Scripts from the Editor

The extension supports to run the selected script as a task when editing the `package.json`file. You can either run a script from
the hover shown on a script or using the command `Run Selected Npm Script`.

### Run Scripts from a Folder in the Explorer

The extension supports running a script as a task from a folder in the Explorer. The command  `Run NPM Script in Folder...` shown in the Explorer context menu finds all scripts in `package.json` files that are contained in this folder. You can then select the script to be executed as a task from the resulting list. You enable this support with the `npm.runScriptFromFolder` which is `false` by default.

### Others

The extension fetches data from <https://registry.npmjs.org> and <https://registry.bower.io> to provide auto-completion and information on hover features on npm dependencies.
