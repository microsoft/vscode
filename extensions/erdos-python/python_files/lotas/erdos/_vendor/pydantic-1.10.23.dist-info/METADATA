Data validation and settings management using Python type hints.

Fast and extensible, *pydantic* plays nicely with your linters/IDE/brain.
Define how data should be in pure, canonical Python 3.7+; validate it with *pydantic*.

## Pydantic Company :rocket:

We've started a company based on the principles that I believe have led to Pydantic's success.
Learning more from the [Company Announcement](https://pydantic.dev/announcement/).

## Help

See [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for more details.

## Installation

Install using `pip install -U pydantic` or `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.
For more installation options to make *pydantic* even faster,
see the [Install](https://docs.pydantic.dev/install/) section in the documentation.

## A Simple Example

```py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name = 'John Doe'
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: List[int] = []

external_data = {'id': '123', 'signup_ts': '2017-06-01 12:22', 'friends': [1, '2', b'3']}
user = User(**external_data)
print(user)
#> User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3]
print(user.id)
#> 123
```

## v1.10.0 (2022-08-30)

* Refactor the whole _pydantic_ `dataclass` decorator to really act like its standard lib equivalent.
  It hence keeps `__eq__`, `__hash__`, ... and makes comparison with its non-validated version possible.
  It also fixes usage of `frozen` dataclasses in fields and usage of `default_factory` in nested dataclasses.
  The support of `Config.extra` has been added.
  Finally, config customization directly via a `dict` is now possible, [#2557](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2557) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
  <br/><br/>
  **BREAKING CHANGES:**
  - The `compiled` boolean (whether _pydantic_ is compiled with cython) has been moved from `main.py` to `version.py`
  - Now that `Config.extra` is supported, `dataclass` ignores by default extra arguments (like `BaseModel`)

## v1.9.2 (2022-08-11)

**Revert Breaking Change**: _v1.9.1_ introduced a breaking change where model fields were
deep copied by default, this release reverts the default behaviour to match _v1.9.0_ and before, 
while also allow deep-copy behaviour via `copy_on_model_validation = 'deep'`. See [#4092](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4092) for more information.

* Allow for shallow copies of model fields, `Config.copy_on_model_validation` is now a str which must be
  `'none'`, `'deep'`, or `'shallow'` corresponding to not copying, deep copy & shallow copy; default `'shallow'`,

* Support `typing.Annotated` hints on model fields. A `Field` may now be set in the type hint with `Annotated[..., Field(...)`; all other annotations are ignored but still visible with `get_type_hints(..., include_extras=True)`, [#2147](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2147) by [@JacobHayes](https://github.com/JacobHayes)

* Support plain `typing.Tuple` type, [#2132](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2132) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Add a bound method `validate` to functions decorated with `validate_arguments`
  to validate parameters without actually calling the function, [#2127](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2127) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Add the ability to customize settings sources (add / disable / change priority order), [#2107](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2107) by [@kozlek](https://github.com/kozlek)
* Fix mypy complaints about most custom _pydantic_ types, [#2098](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2098) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Add a [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) plugin for easier [property-based testing](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/) with Pydantic's custom types - [usage details here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/hypothesis_plugin/), [#2097](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2097) by [@Zac-HD](https://github.com/Zac-HD)

* Fixed issue causing `KeyError` to be raised when building schema from multiple `BaseModel` with the same names declared in separate classes, [#1912](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1912) by [@JSextonn](https://github.com/JSextonn)
* Add `rediss` (Redis over SSL) protocol to `RedisDsn`
  Allow URLs without `user` part (e.g., `rediss://:pass@localhost`), [#1911](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1911) by [@TrDex](https://github.com/TrDex)
* Add a new `frozen` boolean parameter to `Config` (default: `False`).
  Setting `frozen=True` does everything that `allow_mutation=False` does, and also generates a `__hash__()` method for the model. This makes instances of the model potentially hashable if all the attributes are hashable, [#1880](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1880) by [@rhuille](https://github.com/rhuille)
* fix schema generation with multiple Enums having the same name, [#1857](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1857) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

* Fix: some recursive models did not require `update_forward_refs` and silently behaved incorrectly, [#1201](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1201) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Fix bug where generic models with fields where the typevar is nested in another type `a: List[T]` are considered to be concrete. This allows these models to be subclassed and composed as expected, [#947](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/947) by [@daviskirk](https://github.com/daviskirk)
* Add `Config.copy_on_model_validation` flag. When set to `False`, _pydantic_ will keep models used as fields
  untouched on validation instead of reconstructing (copying) them, [#265](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/265) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

## v1.7.4 (2021-05-11)

* **Security fix:** Fix `date` and `datetime` parsing so passing either `'infinity'` or `float('inf')` 
  (or their negative values) does not cause an infinite loop,
  See security advisory [CVE-2021-29510](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh)

* `pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass` decorator now supports built-in `dataclasses.dataclass`.
  It is hence possible to convert an existing `dataclass` easily to add *pydantic* validation.
  Moreover nested dataclasses are also supported, [#744](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/744) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

## v1.6.2 (2021-05-11)

  See security advisory [CVE-2021-29510](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh)

## v1.6.1 (2020-07-15)

* fix validation and parsing of nested models with `default_factory`, [#1710](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1710) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

## v1.6 (2020-07-11)

Thank you to pydantic's sponsors: [@matin](https://github.com/matin), [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), [@chdsbd](https://github.com/chdsbd), [@jorgecarleitao](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao), and 1 anonymous sponsor for their kind support.

* Modify validators for `conlist` and `conset` to not have `always=True`, [#1682](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1682) by [@samuelcolvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin)
* add port check to `AnyUrl` (can't exceed 65536) ports are 16 insigned bits: `0 <= port <= 2**16-1` src: [rfc793 header format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1), [#1654](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1654) by [@flapili](https://github.com/flapili)
* Document default `regex` anchoring semantics, [#1648](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1648) by [@yurikhan](https://github.com/yurikhan)
* Use `chain.from_iterable` in class_validators.py. This is a faster and more idiomatic way of using `itertools.chain`.
  Instead of computing all the items in the iterable and storing them in memory, they are computed one-by-one and never
  stored as a huge list. This can save on both runtime and memory space, [#1642](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1642) by [@cool-RR](https://github.com/cool-RR)
* Add `conset()`, analogous to `conlist()`, [#1623](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1623) by [@patrickkwang](https://github.com/patrickkwang)

* Update mypy, remove `AnyType` alias for `Type[Any]`, [#1598](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1598) by [@samuelcolvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin)
* Adjust handling of root validators so that errors are aggregated from _all_ failing root validators, instead of reporting on only the first root validator to fail, [#1586](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1586) by [@beezee](https://github.com/beezee)
* Make `__modify_schema__` on Enums apply to the enum schema rather than fields that use the enum, [#1581](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1581) by [@therefromhere](https://github.com/therefromhere)
* Fix behavior of `__all__` key when used in conjunction with index keys in advanced include/exclude of fields that are sequences, [#1579](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1579) by [@xspirus](https://github.com/xspirus)
* Subclass validators do not run when referencing a `List` field defined in a parent class when `each_item=True`. Added an example to the docs illustrating this, [#1566](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1566) by [@samueldeklund](https://github.com/samueldeklund)
* change `schema.field_class_to_schema` to support `frozenset` in schema, [#1557](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1557) by [@wangpeibao](https://github.com/wangpeibao)
* Call `__modify_schema__` only for the field schema, [#1552](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1552) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Move the assignment of `field.validate_always` in `fields.py` so the `always` parameter of validators work on inheritance, [#1545](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1545) by [@dcHHH](https://github.com/dcHHH)
* Added support for UUID instantiation through 16 byte strings such as `b'\x12\x34\x56\x78' * 4`. This was done to support `BINARY(16)` columns in sqlalchemy, [#1541](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1541) by [@shawnwall](https://github.com/shawnwall)
* Add a test assertion that `default_factory` can return a singleton, [#1523](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1523) by [@therefromhere](https://github.com/therefromhere)
