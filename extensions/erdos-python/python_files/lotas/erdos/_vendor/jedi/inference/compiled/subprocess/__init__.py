"""
Makes it possible to do the compiled analysis in a subprocess. This has two
goals:

1. Making it safer - Segfaults and RuntimeErrors as well as stdout/stderr can
   be ignored and dealt with.
2. Make it possible to handle different Python versions as well as virtualenvs.

The architecture here is briefly:
 - For each Jedi `Environment` there is a corresponding subprocess which
   operates within the target environment. If the subprocess dies it is replaced
   at this level.
 - `CompiledSubprocess` manages exactly one subprocess and handles communication
   from the parent side.
 - `Listener` runs within the subprocess, processing each request and yielding
   results.
 - `InterpreterEnvironment` provides an API which matches that of `Environment`,
   but runs functionality inline rather than within a subprocess. It is thus
   used both directly in places where a subprocess is unnecessary and/or
   undesirable and also within subprocesses themselves.
 - `InferenceStateSubprocess` (or `InferenceStateSameProcess`) provide high
   level access to functionality within the subprocess from within the parent.
   Each `InterpreterState` has an instance of one of these, provided by its
   environment.
