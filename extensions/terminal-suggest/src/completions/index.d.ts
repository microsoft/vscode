		 * @remarks
		 * Fig's parser relies on your option name being exactly what the user would type. (e.g. if the user types `git "-m"`, you must have `name: "-m"` and not something like `name: "your message"` or even with an `=` sign like`name: "-m="`)
		 *
		 * If you want to customize what the text the popup says, use `displayName`.
		 *
		 * The name prop in an Option object compiles down to the name prop in a Suggestion object
		 *
		 * Final note: the name prop can be a string (most common) or an array of strings
		 *
		 *
		 * @example
		 * For `git commit -m` in the, message option nested beneath `commit` would have `name: ["-m", "--message"]`
		 * @example
		 * For `ls -l` the `-l` option would have `name: "-l"`

		 * Suggestions: Whenever you type a space indicating the start of a new token, Fig will regenerate a new list of suggestions e.g. `git[space]` will generate a list of suggestions for every subcommand, option, and arg
		 * Filtered Suggestions: When you type within the same token (e.g. `git c` -> `git ch`), Fig takes the token you are currently typing in and uses it to filter over the list of suggestions you have cached. e.g. `git c`. The list of suggestions is the same as before, but the filtered suggestions are now `commit`, `clean`, `clone`, and `checkout`.
		 *
		 * **Why don't we recalculate suggestions on each keystroke?**
		 * 1. It's expensive
		 * 2. We don't need to. The caching works nicely
		 *
		 * **So what does the trigger do?**
		 * The trigger function is run on every keystroke and tells us whether or not we should invalidate the cache and regenerate a list of suggestions.
		 * The trigger function is almost always used with a `custom` generator and the `getQueryTerm` function to make the autocomplete experience really good (it's how suggestions for `cd` work)
		 * It is especially beneficial when you want to generate suggestions for an argument contained inside a single string that is not separated by a space.
		 *
		 * **What is important to remember?**
		 * This function looks at the CHANGE in a token, not the current state of the token. If my token goes from `desktop` to `desktop/`, should I regenerate suggestions? Remember, users can paste text so theoretically any change is possible. It is totally valid for oldToken to be an empty string and newToken to be a 50 character string!
		 *
		 *
		 * @param newToken - The new token that was just typed by the user e.g. "desktop/""
		 * @param oldToken - The old token that was there before e.g. "desktop"
		 * @returns A boolean of whether or not we should regenerate suggestions
		 *
		 * @defaultValue
		 * `false`
		 * It means that the function returns false ie we do not regenerate suggestion on each keystroke and instead, keep our cached list of suggestions while the user is editing the current token.
		 *
		 * @example
		 * `chmod`: If I type `chmod u` we should generate suggestions for `u+x`, `u+r`, `u-w` etc. Whereas if I typed `chmod 7` we should generate suggestions for `755` or `777` etc.
		 * The suggestion we generate depends on the new information we have. The oldToken was an empty string, the new token could be a `7` or a `u` etc...
		 *
		 *   All this function's job is to say whether or not we should generate new suggestions. It does not specify how to create these new suggestions. This is the job of the `script` or `custom` props. Annoyingly, you may have to implement some of the same parsing logic again. However, because this is javascript, just create a function so you don't have to repeat yourself :)
		 *
		 *   Note: yes, we could have generate a list of suggestions at the start for every single permutation of 777 or u+x etc, however, there are so many and this is just not performant!
		 *
		 * @example
		 * `cd`: Let's say a user has "cd desktop" currently typed then the user types a "/" so the changes to "cd ~/desktop/".
		 * The old token is "~/desktop", new token is "desktop/". This is a perfect time for us to generate a new list of suggestions. We previously had all the folders in my ~ directory as suggestions, but after the total number of `/` in the tokens changed, we should trigger a new set of suggestions to be generated. This new set of suggestions should then generate suggestions for the desktop directory, not the ~ directory.

		 * Cache the response of generators for a specific period time and optionally by directory the commands were executed in.
		 *
		 * @remarks
		 * For commands that take a long time to run, Fig gives you the option to cache their response. You can cache the response globally or just by the directory they were run in.
		 * We currently have two cache strategies:
		 * - `stale-while-revalidate` (default): when cache becomes stale fig will return the stale data while fetching the updated one. This strategy accepts a `ttl` (time to live) to configure how long it takes for the cache to become stale.
		 * - `max-age`: will show a loading indicator when cache is stale. You need to specify a `ttl` for how long it takes for the cache to become stale.
		 * You can also optionally turn on the ability to just cache by directory (`cacheByDirectory: true`)
		 *
		 * @example
		 * The kubernetes spec makes use of this.
