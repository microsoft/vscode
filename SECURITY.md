---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prioritizing Code Push for a Microsoft Project
It is extremely important to check that the extensions installed are from reliable sources, since they are massively exploiting programs using this method.

* Examples of Dangerous Extensions in Visual Studio Code
* Malicious Linters/Formatters: Extensions that claim to format or lint your code but inject malicious code or steal data in the background.
* "Productivity" Tools with Hidden Agendas: Extensions that offer features like advanced snippets or project management but are designed to compromise your system or exfiltrate sensitive information.
* Themed Extensions: While often harmless, some malicious actors can disguise harmful code within seemingly innocent theme extensions.
* Extensions with Excessive Permissions: Be wary of extensions requesting unnecessary file system access, network access, or the ability to execute arbitrary code. Always review the permissions an extension requests before installing it.

## Always verify the publisher of any extension you install, look for reviews and ratings, and check if the extension is open-source so you can inspect its code if you have concerns. Microsoft also curates a list of recommended extensions, which can be a good starting point.
