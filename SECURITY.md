        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and  
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.  
  
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of  
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,  
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable  
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,  
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the  
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.  
  
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,  
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,  
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable  
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their  
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)  
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You  
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a  
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work  
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct  
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses  
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate  
        as of the date such litigation is filed.  
  
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the  
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without  
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You  
        meet the following conditions:  
  
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or  
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  
  
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices  
            stating that You changed the files; and  
  
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works  
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and  
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,  
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of  
            the Derivative Works; and  
  
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its  
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must  
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained  
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not  
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one  
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed  
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or  
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,  
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and  
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents  
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and  
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution  
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside  
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided  
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed  
            as modifying the License.  
  
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and  
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions  
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or  
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,  
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with  
        the conditions stated in this License.  
  
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,  
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work  
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of  
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.  
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify  
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed  
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  
  
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade  
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,  
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the  
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  
  
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or  
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each  
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,  
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or  
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions  
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A  
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the  
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any  
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  
  
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,  
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,  
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly  
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be  
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,  
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a  
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the  
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,  
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all  
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor  
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  
  
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing  
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,  
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,  
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this  
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only  
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf  
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,  
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability  
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason  
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  Non-Blocking [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) Foundation for the JVM both implementing a [Reactive Extensions](https://reactivex.io) inspired API and efficient event streaming support.  
  
  Since `3.3.x`, this repository also contains `reactor-tools`, a java agent aimed at helping with debugging of Reactor code.  
  
  ## Getting it  
  
  **Reactor 3 requires Java 8 or + to run**.  
  
  With Gradle from repo.spring.io or Maven Central repositories (stable releases only):  
  
  ```groovy  
  repositories {  
      mavenCentral()  
    
      // Uncomment to get access to Milestones  
      // maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/milestone" }  
    
      // Uncomment to get access to Snapshots  
      // maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/snapshot" }  
  }  
    
  dependencies {  
      compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.6.0-M2"  
      testCompile "io.projectreactor:reactor-test:3.6.0-M2"  
    
      // Alternatively, use the following for latest snapshot artifacts in this line  
      // compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.6.0-SNAPSHOT"  
      // testCompile "io.projectreactor:reactor-test:3.6.0-SNAPSHOT"  
    
      // Optionally, use `reactor-tools` to help debugging reactor code  
      // implementation "io.projectreactor:reactor-tools:3.6.0-M2"  
  }  
  ```  
  
  See the [reference documentation](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/docs/index.html#getting)  
  for more information on getting it (eg. using Maven, or on how to get milestones and snapshots).  
  
  > **Note about Android support**: Reactor 3 doesn't officially support nor target Android.  
  However it should work fine with Android SDK 21 (Android 5.0) and above. See the  
  [complete note](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/docs/index.html#prerequisites)  
  in the reference guide.  
  
  ## Trouble building the project?  
  Since the introduction of [Java Multi-Release JAR File](https://openjdk.org/jeps/238)   
  support one needs to have JDK 8, 9, and 21 available on the classpath. All the JDKs should   
  be automatically [detected](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection)   
  or [provisioned](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:provisioning)   
  by Gradle Toolchain.   
  
  However, if you see error message such as `No matching toolchains found for requested   
  specification: {languageVersion=X, vendor=any, implementation=vendor-specific}` (where   
  `X` can be 8, 9 or 21), it means that you need to install the missing JDK:  
  
  ### Installing JDKs with [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)  
  
  In the project root folder run [SDKMAN env initialization](https://sdkman.io/usage#env):   
  
  ```shell  
  sdk env install  
  ```  
  
  then (if needed) install JDK 9:   
  
  ```shell  
  sdk install java $(sdk list java | grep -Eo -m1 '9\b\.[ea|0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]{1,2}-open')  
  ```  
  
  then (if needed) install JDK 21:  
  
  ```shell  
  sdk install java $(sdk list java | grep -Eo -m1 '21\b\.[ea|0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]{1,2}-open')  
  ```  
  
  When the installations succeed, try to refresh the project and see that it builds.  
  
  ### Installing JDKs manually  
  
  The manual Operation-system specific JDK installation  
  is well explained in the [official docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/install/overview-jdk-installation.html)  
  
  ## Getting Started  
  
  New to Reactive Programming or bored of reading already ? Try the [Introduction to Reactor Core hands-on](https://github.com/reactor/lite-rx-api-hands-on) !  
  
  If you are familiar with RxJava or if you want to check more detailed introduction, be sure to check   
  https://www.infoq.com/articles/reactor-by-example !  
  
  ## Flux  
  
  A Reactive Streams Publisher with basic flow operators.  
  - Static factories on Flux allow for source generation from arbitrary callbacks types.  
  - Instance methods allows operational building, materialized on each subscription (_Flux#subscribe()_, ...) or multicasting operations (such as _Flux#publish_ and _Flux#publishNext_).  
  
  [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/reactor-core/v3.1.3.RELEASE/src/docs/marble/flux.png" width="500" style="background-color: white">](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html)  
  
  Flux in action :  
  ```java  
  Flux.fromIterable(getSomeLongList())  
      .mergeWith(Flux.interval(100))  
      .doOnNext(serviceA::someObserver)  
      .map(d -> d * 2)  
      .take(3)  
      .onErrorResume(errorHandler::fallback)  
      .doAfterTerminate(serviceM::incrementTerminate)  
      .subscribe(System.out::println);  
  ```  
  
  ## Mono  
  A Reactive Streams Publisher constrained to *ZERO* or *ONE* element with appropriate operators.   
  - Static factories on Mono allow for deterministic *zero or one* sequence generation from arbitrary callbacks types.  
  - Instance methods allows operational building, materialized on each _Mono#subscribe()_ or _Mono#get()_ eventually called.  
  
  [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/reactor-core/v3.4.1/reactor-core/src/main/java/reactor/core/publisher/doc-files/marbles/mono.svg" width="500" style="background-color: white">](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html)  
  
  Mono in action :  
  ```java  
  Mono.fromCallable(System::currentTimeMillis)  
      .flatMap(time -> Mono.first(serviceA.findRecent(time), serviceB.findRecent(time)))  
      .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3), errorHandler::fallback)  
      .doOnSuccess(r -> serviceM.incrementSuccess())  
      .subscribe(System.out::println);  
  ```  
  
  Blocking Mono result :  
  ```java      
  Tuple2<Long, Long> nowAndLater =   
          Mono.zip(  
                  Mono.just(System.currentTimeMillis()),  
                  Flux.just(1).delay(1).map(i -> System.currentTimeMillis()))  
              .block();  
  ```  
  
  ## Schedulers  
  
  Reactor uses a [Scheduler](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Scheduler.html) as a  
  contract for arbitrary task execution. It provides some guarantees required by Reactive  
  Streams flows like FIFO execution.  
  
  You can use or create efficient [schedulers](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html)  
  to jump thread on the producing flows (subscribeOn) or receiving flows (publishOn):  
  
  ```java  
  
  Mono.fromCallable( () -> System.currentTimeMillis() )  
          .repeat()  
      .publishOn(Schedulers.single())  
      .log("foo.bar")  
      .flatMap(time ->  
          Mono.fromCallable(() -> { Thread.sleep(1000); return time; })  
              .subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel())  
      , 8) //maxConcurrency 8  
      .subscribe();  
  ```  
  
  ## ParallelFlux  
  
  [ParallelFlux](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/ParallelFlux.html) can starve your CPU's from any sequence whose work can be subdivided in concurrent  
   tasks. Turn back into a `Flux` with `ParallelFlux#sequential()`, an unordered join or  
   use arbitrary merge strategies via 'groups()'.  
  
  ```java  
  Mono.fromCallable( () -> System.currentTimeMillis() )  
          .repeat()  
      .parallel(8) //parallelism  
      .runOn(Schedulers.parallel())  
      .doOnNext( d -> System.out.println("I'm on thread "+Thread.currentThread()) )  
      .subscribe()  
  ```  
  
  
  ## Custom sources : Flux.create and FluxSink, Mono.create and MonoSink  
  To bridge a Subscriber or Processor into an outside context that is taking care of  
  producing non concurrently, use `Flux#create`, `Mono#create`.  
  
  ```java  
  Flux.create(sink -> {  
           ActionListener al = e -> {  
              sink.next(textField.getText());  
           };  
  
           // without cancellation support:  
           button.addActionListener(al);  
  
           // with cancellation support:  
           sink.onCancel(() -> {  
                   button.removeListener(al);  
           });  
      },  
      // Overflow (backpressure) handling, default is BUFFER  
      FluxSink.OverflowStrategy.LATEST)  
      .timeout(3)  
      .doOnComplete(() -> System.out.println("completed!"))  
      .subscribe(System.out::println)  
  ```  
  
  ## The Backpressure Thing  
  
  Most of this cool stuff uses bounded ring buffer implementation under the hood to mitigate signal processing difference between producers and consumers. Now, the operators and processors or any standard reactive stream component working on the sequence will be instructed to flow in when these buffers have free room AND only then. This means that we make sure we both have a deterministic capacity model (bounded buffer) and we never block (request more data on write capacity). Yup, it's not rocket science after all, the boring part is already being worked by us in collaboration with [Reactive Streams Commons](https://github.com/reactor/reactive-streams-commons) on going research effort.  
  
  ## What's more in it ?  
  
  "Operator Fusion" (flow optimizers), health state observers, helpers to build custom reactive components, bounded queue generator, converters from/to Java 9 Flow, Publisher and Java 8 CompletableFuture. The repository contains a `reactor-test` project with test features like the [`StepVerifier`](https://projectreactor.io/docs/test/release/api/index.html?reactor/test/StepVerifier.html).

  ## Types  
  
    <a name="types--primitives"></a><a name="1.1"></a>  
    - [1.1](#types--primitives) **Primitives**: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.  
  
      - `string`  
      - `number`  
      - `boolean`  
      - `null`  
      - `undefined`  
      - `symbol`  
      - `bigint`  
  
      <br />  
  
      ```javascript  
      const foo = 1;  
      let bar = foo;  
  
      bar = 9;  
  
      console.log(foo, bar); // => 1, 9  
      ```  
    
      - Symbols and BigInts cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that don’t support them natively.  
    
    <a name="types--complex"></a><a name="1.2"></a>  
    - [1.2](#types--complex)  **Complex**: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.  
    
      - `object`  
      - `array`  
      - `function`  
  
      <br />  
  
      ```javascript  
      const foo = [1, 2];  
      const bar = foo;  
  
      bar[0] = 9;  
  
      console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // => 9, 9  
      ```

  ## References  
  
    <a name="references--prefer-const"></a><a name="2.1"></a>  
    - [2.1](#references--prefer-const) Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`. eslint: [`prefer-const`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const), [`no-const-assign`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-const-assign)  
  
      > Why? This ensures that you can’t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      var a = 1;  
      var b = 2;  
  
      // good  
      const a = 1;  
      const b = 2;  
      ```  
  
    <a name="references--disallow-var"></a><a name="2.2"></a>  
    - [2.2](#references--disallow-var) If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. eslint: [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var)  
  
      > Why? `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      var count = 1;  
      if (true) {  
        count += 1;  
      }  
  
      // good, use the let.  
      let count = 1;  
      if (true) {  
        count += 1;  
      }  
      ```  
    
    <a name="references--block-scope"></a><a name="2.3"></a>  
    - [2.3](#references--block-scope) Note that both `let` and `const` are block-scoped, whereas `var` is function-scoped.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // const and let only exist in the blocks they are defined in.  
      {  
        let a = 1;  
        const b = 1;  
        var c = 1;  
      }  
      console.log(a); // ReferenceError  
      console.log(b); // ReferenceError  
      console.log(c); // Prints 1  
      ```  
  
      In the above code, you can see that referencing `a` and `b` will produce a ReferenceError, while `c` contains the number. This is because `a` and `b` are block scoped, while `c` is scoped to the containing function.  
  
  **[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**  
  
  ## Objects  
  
    <a name="objects--no-new"></a><a name="3.1"></a>  
    - [3.1](#objects--no-new) Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: [`no-new-object`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-object)  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      const item = new Object();  
  
      // good  
      const item = {};  
      ```  
    
    <a name="es6-computed-properties"></a><a name="3.4"></a>  
    - [3.2](#es6-computed-properties) Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.  
    
      > Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.  
    
      ```javascript  
  
      function getKey(k) {  
        return `a key named ${k}`;  
      }  
  
      // bad  
      const obj = {  
        id: 5,  
        name: 'San Francisco',  
      };  
      obj[getKey('enabled')] = true;  
  
      // good  
      const obj = {  
        id: 5,  
        name: 'San Francisco',  
        [getKey('enabled')]: true,  
      };  
      ```  
    
    <a name="es6-object-shorthand"></a><a name="3.5"></a>  
    - [3.3](#es6-object-shorthand) Use object method shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      const atom = {  
        value: 1,  
  
        addValue: function (value) {  
          return atom.value + value;  
        },  
      };  
  
      // good  
      const atom = {  
        value: 1,  
  
        addValue(value) {  
          return atom.value + value;  
        },  
      };  
      ```  
    
    <a name="es6-object-concise"></a><a name="3.6"></a>  
    - [3.4](#es6-object-concise) Use property value shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)  
    
      > Why? It is shorter and descriptive.  
    
      ```javascript  
      const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';  
  
      // bad  
      const obj = {  
        lukeSkywalker: lukeSkywalker,  
      };  
  
      // good  
      const obj = {  
        lukeSkywalker,  
      };  
      ```  
    
    <a name="objects--grouped-shorthand"></a><a name="3.7"></a>  
    - [3.5](#objects--grouped-shorthand) Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.  
    
      > Why? It’s easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.  
    
      ```javascript  
      const anakinSkywalker = 'Anakin Skywalker';  
      const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';  
  
      // bad  
      const obj = {  
        episodeOne: 1,  
        twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,  
        lukeSkywalker,  
        episodeThree: 3,  
        mayTheFourth: 4,  
        anakinSkywalker,  
      };  
  
      // good  
      const obj = {  
        lukeSkywalker,  
        anakinSkywalker,  
        episodeOne: 1,  
        twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,  
        episodeThree: 3,  
        mayTheFourth: 4,  
      };  
      ```  
    
    <a name="objects--quoted-props"></a><a name="3.8"></a>  
    - [3.6](#objects--quoted-props) Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: [`quote-props`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quote-props)  
    
      > Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      const bad = {  
        'foo': 3,  
        'bar': 4,  
        'data-blah': 5,  
      };  
  
      // good  
      const good = {  
        foo: 3,  
        bar: 4,  
        'data-blah': 5,  
      };  
      ```  
    
    <a name="objects--prototype-builtins"></a>  
    - [3.7](#objects--prototype-builtins) Do not call `Object.prototype` methods directly, such as `hasOwnProperty`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, and `isPrototypeOf`. eslint: [`no-prototype-builtins`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-prototype-builtins)  
    
      > Why? These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider `{ hasOwnProperty: false }` - or, the object may be a null object (`Object.create(null)`). In modern browsers that support ES2022, or with a polyfill such as <https://npmjs.com/object.hasown>, `Object.hasOwn` can also be used as an alternative to `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`.  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      console.log(object.hasOwnProperty(key));  
  
      // good  
      console.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key));  
  
      // better  
      const has = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; // cache the lookup once, in module scope.  
      console.log(has.call(object, key));  
  
      // best  
      console.log(Object.hasOwn(object, key)); // only supported in browsers that support ES2022  
  
      /* or */  
      import has from 'has'; // https://www.npmjs.com/package/has  
      console.log(has(object, key));  
      /* or */  
      console.log(Object.hasOwn(object, key)); // https://www.npmjs.com/package/object.hasown  
      ```  
    
    <a name="objects--rest-spread"></a>  
    - [3.8](#objects--rest-spread) Prefer the object spread syntax over [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) to shallow-copy objects. Use the object rest parameter syntax to get a new object with certain properties omitted. eslint: [`prefer-object-spread`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-object-spread)  
    
      ```javascript  
      // very bad  
      const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };  
      const copy = Object.assign(original, { c: 3 }); // this mutates `original` ಠ_ಠ  
      delete copy.a; // so does this  
  
      // bad  
      const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };  
      const copy = Object.assign({}, original, { c: 3 }); // copy => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }  
  
      // good  
      const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };  
      const copy = { ...original, c: 3 }; // copy => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }  
  
      const { a, ...noA } = copy; // noA => { b: 2, c: 3 }  
      ```  
    
  **[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**  
    
  ## Arrays  
    
    <a name="arrays--literals"></a><a name="4.1"></a>  
    - [4.1](#arrays--literals) Use the literal syntax for array creation. eslint: [`no-array-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-array-constructor)  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      const items = new Array();  
    
      // good  
      const items = [];  
      ```  
  
    <a name="arrays--push"></a><a name="4.2"></a>  
    - [4.2](#arrays--push) Use [Array#push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.  
  
      ```javascript  
      const someStack = [];  
    
      // bad  
      someStack[someStack.length] = 'abracadabra';  
    
      // good  
      someStack.push('abracadabra');  
      ```  
  
    <a name="es6-array-spreads"></a><a name="4.3"></a>  
    - [4.3](#es6-array-spreads) Use array spreads `...` to copy arrays.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      const len = items.length;  
      const itemsCopy = [];  
      let i;  
    
      for (i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {  
        itemsCopy[i] = items[i];  
      }  
    
      // good  
      const itemsCopy = [...items];  
      ```  
  
    <a name="arrays--from"></a>  
    <a name="arrays--from-iterable"></a><a name="4.4"></a>  
    - [4.4](#arrays--from-iterable) To convert an iterable object to an array, use spreads `...` instead of [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from)  
  
      ```javascript  
      const foo = document.querySelectorAll('.foo');  
    
      // good  
      const nodes = Array.from(foo);  
    
      // best  
      const nodes = [...foo];  
      ```  
  
    <a name="arrays--from-array-like"></a>

  ## Destructuring  
    
    <a name="destructuring--object"></a><a name="5.1"></a>  
    - [5.1](#destructuring--object) Use object destructuring when accessing and using multiple properties of an object. eslint: [`prefer-destructuring`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)  
    
      > Why? Destructuring saves you from creating temporary references for those properties, and from repetitive access of the object. Repeating object access creates more repetitive code, requires more reading, and creates more opportunities for mistakes. Destructuring objects also provides a single site of definition of the object structure that is used in the block, rather than requiring reading the entire block to determine what is used.

    <a name="destructuring--object-over-array"></a><a name="5.3"></a>  
    - [5.3](#destructuring--object-over-array) Use object destructuring for multiple return values, not array destructuring.  
    
      > Why? You can add new properties over time or change the order of things without breaking call sites.  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      function processInput(input) {

    <a name="strings--line-length"></a><a name="6.2"></a>  
    - [6.2](#strings--line-length) Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should not be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.

      ```  
    
    <a name="es6-template-literals"></a><a name="6.4"></a>  
    - [6.3](#es6-template-literals) When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. eslint: [`prefer-template`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template) [`template-curly-spacing`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/template-curly-spacing)  
    
      > Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

    <a name="strings--escaping"></a>  
    - [6.5](#strings--escaping) Do not unnecessarily escape characters in strings. eslint: [`no-useless-escape`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-useless-escape)

  ## Functions  
    
    <a name="functions--declarations"></a><a name="7.1"></a>  
    - [7.1](#functions--declarations) Use named function expressions instead of function declarations. eslint: [`func-style`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/func-style), [`func-names`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/func-names)  
    
      > Why? Function declarations are hoisted, which means that it’s easy - too easy - to reference the function before it is defined in the file. This harms readability and maintainability. If you find that a function’s definition is large or complex enough that it is interfering with understanding the rest of the file, then perhaps it’s time to extract it to its own module! Don’t forget to explicitly name the expression, regardless of whether or not the name is inferred from the containing variable (which is often the case in modern browsers or when using compilers such as Babel). This eliminates any assumptions made about the Error’s call stack. ([Discussion](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/794))  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      function foo() {  
        // ...  
      }  
  
      // bad

      ```  
    
    <a name="functions--iife"></a><a name="7.2"></a>  
    - [7.2](#functions--iife) Wrap immediately invoked function expressions in parentheses. eslint: [`wrap-iife`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/wrap-iife)  
    
      > Why? An immediately invoked function expression is a single unit - wrapping both it, and its invocation parens, in parens, cleanly expresses this. Note that in a world with modules everywhere, you almost never need an IIFE.  
    
      ```javascript  
      // immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)  
      (function () {  
        console.log('Welcome to the Internet. Please follow me.');

      ```  
    
    <a name="functions--in-blocks"></a><a name="7.3"></a>  
    - [7.3](#functions--in-blocks) Never declare a function in a non-function block (`if`, `while`, etc). Assign the function to a variable instead. Browsers will allow you to do it, but they all interpret it differently, which is bad news bears. eslint: [`no-loop-func`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-loop-func)  
    
    <a name="functions--note-on-blocks"></a><a name="7.4"></a>

    <a name="functions--arguments-shadow"></a><a name="7.5"></a>  
    - [7.5](#functions--arguments-shadow) Never name a parameter `arguments`. This will take precedence over the `arguments` object that is given to every function scope.

    <a name="es6-rest"></a><a name="7.6"></a>  
    - [7.6](#es6-rest) Never use `arguments`, opt to use rest syntax `...` instead. eslint: [`prefer-rest-params`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-rest-params)  
    
      > Why? `...` is explicit about which arguments you want pulled. Plus, rest arguments are a real Array, and not merely Array-like like `arguments`.  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      function concatenateAll() {  
        const args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);

  ## Arrow Functions  
  
    <a name="arrows--use-them"></a><a name="8.1"></a>  
    - [8.1](#arrows--use-them) When you must use an anonymous function (as when passing an inline callback), use arrow function notation. eslint: [`prefer-arrow-callback`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-arrow-callback), [`arrow-spacing`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/arrow-spacing)  
  
      > Why? It creates a version of the function that executes in the context of `this`, which is usually what you want, and is a more concise syntax.  
  
      > Why not? If you have a fairly complicated function, you might move that logic out into its own named function expression.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      [1, 2, 3].map(function (x) {  
        const y = x + 1;  
        return x * y;

    <a name="variables--unary-increment-decrement"></a><a name="13.6"></a>  
    - [13.6](#variables--unary-increment-decrement) Avoid using unary increments and decrements (`++`, `--`). eslint [`no-plusplus`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-plusplus)  
    
      > Why? Per the eslint documentation, unary increment and decrement statements are subject to automatic semicolon insertion and can cause silent errors with incrementing or decrementing values within an application. It is also more expressive to mutate your values with statements like `num += 1` instead of `num++` or `num ++`. Disallowing unary increment and decrement statements also prevents you from pre-incrementing/pre-decrementing values unintentionally which can also cause unexpected behavior in your programs.

      > Why? When variables, classes, or functions are declared after being used, it can harm readability since a reader won't know what a thing that's referenced is. It's much clearer for a reader to first encounter the source of a thing (whether imported from another module, or defined in the file) before encountering a use of the thing.  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
  
      // Variable a is being used before it is being defined.  
      console.log(a); // this will be undefined, since while the declaration is hoisted, the initialization is not  
      var a = 10;  
  
      // Function fun is being called before being defined.  
      fun();  
      function fun() {}  
  
      // Class A is being used before being defined.  
      new A(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'A' before initialization  
      class A {  
      }  
  
      // `let` and `const` are hoisted, but they don't have a default initialization.  
      // The variables 'a' and 'b' are in a Temporal Dead Zone where JavaScript  
      // knows they exist (declaration is hoisted) but they are not accessible  
      // (as they are not yet initialized).  
  
      console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization  
      console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization

  ## Comparison Operators & Equality  
    
    <a name="comparison--eqeqeq"></a><a name="15.1"></a>  
    - [15.1](#comparison--eqeqeq) Use `===` and `!==` over `==` and `!=`. eslint: [`eqeqeq`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/eqeqeq)  
    
    <a name="comparison--if"></a><a name="15.2"></a>  
    - [15.2](#comparison--if) Conditional statements such as the `if` statement evaluate their expression using coercion with the `ToBoolean` abstract method and always follow these simple rules:  
    
      - **Objects** evaluate to **true**  
      - **Undefined** evaluates to **false**  
      - **Null** evaluates to **false**  
      - **Booleans** evaluate to **the value of the boolean**  
      - **Numbers** evaluate to **false** if **+0, -0, or NaN**, otherwise **true**  
      - **Strings** evaluate to **false** if an empty string `''`, otherwise **true**  
    
      ```javascript  
      if ([0] && []) {  
        // true  
        // an array (even an empty one) is an object, objects will evaluate to true  
      }  
      ```  
    
    <a name="comparison--shortcuts"></a><a name="15.3"></a>  
    - [15.3](#comparison--shortcuts) Use shortcuts for booleans, but explicit comparisons for strings and numbers.

      if (isValid === true) {  
        // ...

    <a name="comparison--switch-blocks"></a><a name="15.5"></a>  
    - [15.5](#comparison--switch-blocks) Use braces to create blocks in `case` and `default` clauses that contain lexical declarations (e.g. `let`, `const`, `function`, and `class`). eslint: [`no-case-declarations`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-case-declarations)  
  
      > Why? Lexical declarations are visible in the entire `switch` block but only get initialized when assigned, which only happens when its `case` is reached. This causes problems when multiple `case` clauses attempt to define the same thing.

    - [15.8](#comparison--no-mixed-operators) When mixing operators, enclose them in parentheses. The only exception is the standard arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, and `**` since their precedence is broadly understood. We recommend enclosing `/` and `*` in parentheses because their precedence can be ambiguous when they are mixed.

    <a name="nullish-coalescing-operator"></a>  
    - [15.9](#nullish-coalescing-operator) The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is `null` or `undefined`. Otherwise, it returns the left-hand side operand.  
  
      > Why? It provides precision by distinguishing null/undefined from other falsy values, enhancing code clarity and predictability.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad

    - [17.1](#control-statements) In case your control statement (`if`, `while` etc.) gets too long or exceeds the maximum line length, each (grouped) condition could be put into a new line. The logical operator should begin the line.  
  
      > Why? Requiring operators at the beginning of the line keeps the operators aligned and follows a pattern similar to method chaining. This also improves readability by making it easier to visually follow complex logic.

    - [21.1](#semicolons--required) **Yup.** eslint: [`semi`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi)  
    
      > Why? When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, it uses a set of rules called [Automatic Semicolon Insertion](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion) to determine whether it should regard that line break as the end of a statement, and (as the name implies) place a semicolon into your code before the line break if it thinks so. ASI contains a few eccentric behaviors, though, and your code will break if JavaScript misinterprets your line break. These rules will become more complicated as new features become a part of JavaScript. Explicitly terminating your statements and configuring your linter to catch missing semicolons will help prevent you from encountering issues.  
    
      ```javascript  
      // bad - raises exception  
      const luke = {}  
      const leia = {}

        // ...  
      }())  
  
      // bad - returns `undefined` instead of the value on the next line - always happens when `return` is on a line by itself because of ASI!  
      function foo() {

      > Why? The `parseInt` function produces an integer value dictated by interpretation of the contents of the string argument according to the specified radix. Leading whitespace in string is ignored. If radix is `undefined` or `0`, it is assumed to be `10` except when the number begins with the character pairs `0x` or `0X`, in which case a radix of 16 is assumed. This differs from ECMAScript 3, which merely discouraged (but allowed) octal interpretation. Many implementations have not adopted this behavior as of 2013. And, because older browsers must be supported, always specify a radix.

      > Why? JavaScript does not have the concept of privacy in terms of properties or methods. Although a leading underscore is a common convention to mean “private”, in fact, these properties are fully public, and as such, are part of your public API contract. This convention might lead developers to wrongly think that a change won’t count as breaking, or that tests aren’t needed. tl;dr: if you want something to be “private”, it must not be observably present.

      ```  
  
    <a name="accessors--boolean-prefix"></a><a name="23.3"></a>  
    - [24.3](#accessors--boolean-prefix) If the property/method is a `boolean`, use `isVal()` or `hasVal()`.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      if (!dragon.age()) {  
        return false;  
      }  
    
      // good  
      if (!dragon.hasAge()) {  
        return false;  
      }  
      ```  
  
    <a name="accessors--consistent"></a><a name="23.4"></a>  
    - [24.4](#accessors--consistent) It’s okay to create `get()` and `set()` functions, but be consistent.  
  
      ```javascript  
      class Jedi {  
        constructor(options = {}) {  
          const lightsaber = options.lightsaber || 'blue';  
          this.set('lightsaber', lightsaber);  
        }  
    
        set(key, val) {  
          this[key] = val;  
        }  
    
        get(key) {  
          return this[key];  
        }

  ## Events  
  
    <a name="events--hash"></a><a name="24.1"></a>  
    - [25.1](#events--hash) When attaching data payloads to events (whether DOM events or something more proprietary like Backbone events), pass an object literal (also known as a "hash") instead of a raw value. This allows a subsequent contributor to add more data to the event payload without finding and updating every handler for the event. For example, instead of:  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      $(this).trigger('listingUpdated', listing.id);  
    
      // ...  
    
      $(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, listingID) => {  
        // do something with listingID  
      });  
      ```  
  
      prefer:  
  
      ```javascript  
      // good  
      $(this).trigger('listingUpdated', { listingID: listing.id });  
    
      // ...  
    
      $(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, data) => {  
        // do something with data.listingID  
      });  
      ```  
  
    **[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**  
  
  ## jQuery  
  
    <a name="jquery--dollar-prefix"></a><a name="25.1"></a>  
    - [26.1](#jquery--dollar-prefix) Prefix jQuery object variables with a `$`.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      const sidebar = $('.sidebar');  
    
      // good  
      const $sidebar = $('.sidebar');  
    
      // good  
      const $sidebarBtn = $('.sidebar-btn');  
      ```  
  
    <a name="jquery--cache"></a><a name="25.2"></a>  
    - [26.2](#jquery--cache) Cache jQuery lookups.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      function setSidebar() {  
        $('.sidebar').hide();  
    
        // ...  
    
        $('.sidebar').css({  
          'background-color': 'pink',  
        });  
      }  
    
      // good  
      function setSidebar() {  
        const $sidebar = $('.sidebar');  
        $sidebar.hide();  
    
        // ...  
    
        $sidebar.css({  
          'background-color': 'pink',  
        });  
      }  
      ```  
  
    <a name="jquery--queries"></a><a name="25.3"></a>  
    - [26.3](#jquery--queries) For DOM queries use Cascading `$('.sidebar ul')` or parent > child `$('.sidebar > ul')`. [jsPerf](https://web.archive.org/web/20200414183810/https://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-context-sel/16)  
  
    <a name="jquery--find"></a><a name="25.4"></a>  
    - [26.4](#jquery--find) Use `find` with scoped jQuery object queries.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      $('ul', '.sidebar').hide();  
    
      // bad  
      $('.sidebar').find('ul').hide();  
    
      // good  
      $('.sidebar ul').hide();  
    
      // good  
      $('.sidebar > ul').hide();  
    
      // good  
      $sidebar.find('ul').hide();  
      ```

    <a name="tc39-proposals"></a>  
    - [28.2](#tc39-proposals) Do not use [TC39 proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) that have not reached stage 3.  
  
      > Why? [They are not finalized](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/), and they are subject to change or to be withdrawn entirely. We want to use JavaScript, and proposals are not JavaScript yet.

  ## Standard Library  
  
    The [Standard Library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)  
    contains utilities that are functionally broken but remain for legacy reasons.  
  
    <a name="standard-library--isnan"></a>  
    - [29.1](#standard-library--isnan) Use `Number.isNaN` instead of global `isNaN`.  
      eslint: [`no-restricted-globals`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-globals)  
  
      > Why? The global `isNaN` coerces non-numbers to numbers, returning true for anything that coerces to NaN.  
      > If this behavior is desired, make it explicit.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      isNaN('1.2'); // false  
      isNaN('1.2.3'); // true  
    
      // good  
      Number.isNaN('1.2.3'); // false  
      Number.isNaN(Number('1.2.3')); // true  
      ```  
  
    <a name="standard-library--isfinite"></a>  
    - [29.2](#standard-library--isfinite) Use `Number.isFinite` instead of global `isFinite`.  
      eslint: [`no-restricted-globals`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-globals)  
  
      > Why? The global `isFinite` coerces non-numbers to numbers, returning true for anything that coerces to a finite number.  
      > If this behavior is desired, make it explicit.  
  
      ```javascript  
      // bad  
      isFinite('2e3'); // true  
    
      // good  
      Number.isFinite('2e3'); // false  
      Number.isFinite(parseInt('2e3', 10)); // true  
      ```

  ## Testing  
  
    <a name="testing--yup"></a><a name="28.1"></a>  
    - [30.1](#testing--yup) **Yup.**  
  
      ```javascript  
      function foo() {  
        return true;  
      }  
      ```  
  
    <a name="testing--for-real"></a><a name="28.2"></a>  
    - [30.2](#testing--for-real) **No, but seriously**:  
      - Whichever testing framework you use, you should be writing tests!  
      - Strive to write many small pure functions, and minimize where mutations occur.  
      - Be cautious about stubs and mocks - they can make your tests more brittle.  
      - We primarily use [`mocha`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) and [`jest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) at Airbnb. [`tape`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) is also used occasionally for small, separate modules.  
      - 100% test coverage is a good goal to strive for, even if it’s not always practical to reach it.  
      - Whenever you fix a bug, *write a regression test*. A bug fixed without a regression test is almost certainly going to break again in the future.
