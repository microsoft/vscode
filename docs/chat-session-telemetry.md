# Chat Session Telemetry Implementation

This implementation adds comprehensive GDPR-compliant telemetry for chat session lifecycle events in VS Code.

## Telemetry Events

### 1. chatSessionCreated
Tracks when new chat sessions are created or restored.

**Data collected:**
- `sessionId`: Random session identifier 
- `location`: Where the session was created (Chat panel, inline, etc.)
- `isRestored`: Whether this session was restored from storage
- `hasHistory`: Whether the session has existing conversation history
- `requestCount`: Number of requests in the session (for restored sessions)

### 2. chatSessionDisposed
Tracks when chat sessions are disposed/cleared.

**Data collected:**
- `sessionId`: Random session identifier
- `reason`: Why the session was disposed ('cleared', 'disposed', 'error')
- `durationMs`: How long the session was active in milliseconds
- `requestCount`: Total number of requests in the session
- `responseCount`: Total number of responses in the session

### 3. chatSessionRestored
Tracks session restoration attempts from persistent storage.

**Data collected:**
- `sessionId`: Random session identifier
- `success`: Whether the session was successfully restored
- `errorCode`: Error code if restoration failed
- `requestCount`: Number of requests in the restored session
- `ageInDays`: How old the session was when restored

### 4. chatSessionPersisted
Tracks when sessions are written to persistent storage.

**Data collected:**
- `sessionId`: Random session identifier
- `success`: Whether the session was successfully persisted
- `errorCode`: Error code if persistence failed
- `requestCount`: Number of requests in the session
- `sizeInBytes`: Size of the session data in bytes

## GDPR Compliance

All telemetry follows VS Code's GDPR patterns:

- **Classifications**: Uses appropriate `SystemMetaData` classification for non-personal data
- **Purposes**: Uses `FeatureInsight` for usage patterns and `PerformanceAndHealth` for diagnostics
- **Comments**: Clear explanations of what each field contains and why it's collected
- **Owner**: Properly attributed to `roblourens`
- **isMeasurement**: Correctly marked for numeric values used in calculations

## Privacy Protection

The implementation ensures no sensitive data is collected:
- ❌ No user content or conversation data
- ❌ No file paths or personal identifiers
- ❌ No usernames or email addresses
- ✅ Only session metadata and performance metrics
- ✅ Uses anonymous session IDs for correlation

## Integration Points

- **ChatService**: Session creation and disposal events
- **ChatSessionStore**: Session persistence events
- **ChatServiceTelemetry**: Centralized telemetry emission

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage in `chatSessionTelemetry.test.ts` validates:
- Telemetry event emission for all lifecycle events
- GDPR-compliant data structure
- No sensitive data leakage
- Proper error handling and edge cases
