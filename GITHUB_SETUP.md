# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Creating the Private Repository

To complete the setup, you need to create a private GitHub repository and push the code. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `vscode-ai-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "VSCode fork with AI-powered browser and chat interface"
   - **Visibility**: Select "Private"
   - **Initialize**: Do NOT check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push Code

Run these commands in your terminal (in the vscode directory):

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vscode-ai-app.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin ai-app-modification
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Share with visopsys User

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Manage access"
4. Click "Invite a collaborator"
5. Enter `visopsys` as the username
6. Select "Write" or "Admin" access level
7. Click "Add visopsys to this repository"

### Step 4: Verify the Setup

1. Check that all files are uploaded correctly
2. Verify that the README_AI_APP.md file is visible
3. Test that the repository is accessible to the visopsys user
