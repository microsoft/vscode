    # Classify all files with suffix `.test` as test code.
    # Note: use only forward slash / as a path separator.

    # ** Matches any sequence of characters, including a forward slash.
    # This wildcard must either be surrounded by forward slash symbols, or used as the first segment of a path.
    # It matches zero or more whole directory segments. There is no need to use a wildcard at the end of a directory path because all sub-directories are automatically matched.
    # That is, /anything/ matches the anything directory and all its subdirectories.
    # Always enclose the expression in double quotes if it includes *.
