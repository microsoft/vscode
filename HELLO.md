## Getting Started

### First Steps
1. **Read the fundamentals**: Start with [README.md](README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. **Set up your development environment**: Follow the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) guide
3. **Build the project**: Successfully compile VS Code from source before making any changes
4. **Run tests**: Ensure all existing tests pass in your environment

### Essential Tools
- **Git**: Master basic Git workflows (clone, branch, commit, push, pull request)
- **Node.js/npm**: Understand package management and build scripts
- **TypeScript**: Familiarize yourself with VS Code's primary language
- **Visual Studio Code**: Use the editor you're helping to build!

## Understanding the VS Code Architecture

### Key Directories
```
src/vs/base/         # Foundation utilities and cross-platform abstractions
src/vs/platform/     # Platform services and dependency injection
src/vs/editor/       # Core text editor functionality
src/vs/workbench/    # Main application UI and features
extensions/          # Built-in extensions
test/               # Integration tests
scripts/            # Build and development scripts
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Layered Design**: Code flows from `base` â†’ `platform` â†’ `editor` â†’ `workbench`
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected through constructors
- **Contribution Points**: Features register through extension points
- **Cross-Platform**: Web, desktop, and server implementations

### Pro Tip
Always understand which layer you're working in. Lower layers (base, platform) should never depend on higher layers (workbench).

## Development Workflow

### Before You Code
1. **Understand the issue**: Read the GitHub issue thoroughly and ask questions if unclear
2. **Explore existing code**: Find similar implementations to understand patterns
3. **Plan your approach**: Discuss your solution with mentors before implementing
4. **Write tests first**: Consider test-driven development for new features

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start fresh**: Pull latest changes from main branch daily
2. **Create feature branches**: Use descriptive names like `fix/issue-12345-terminal-crash`
3. **Commit frequently**: Make small, logical commits with clear messages
4. **Test continuously**: Run relevant tests after each significant change
5. **Lint your code**: Use `npm run eslint` to catch style issues early

### Code Reviews
- **Self-review first**: Review your own PR before requesting review
- **Provide context**: Explain why you made certain decisions
- **Be responsive**: Address feedback promptly and professionally
- **Learn from feedback**: Each review is a learning opportunity

## Code Contribution Best Practices

### TypeScript Guidelines
```typescript
// Use PascalCase for types and interfaces
interface MyServiceInterface {
    doSomething(): void;
}

// Use camelCase for functions and variables
function calculateValue(inputData: string): number {
    const processedValue = processInput(inputData);
    return processedValue;
}

// Use dependency injection for services
constructor(
    @IMyService private readonly myService: IMyService,
    @ITelemetryService private readonly telemetryService: ITelemetryService
) {
    super();
}
```

### Code Style
- **Use tabs for indentation** (not spaces)
- **Add JSDoc comments** for public APIs
- **Localize user-facing strings** using `nls.localize()`
- **Handle errors gracefully** with proper error handling
- **Write self-documenting code** with clear variable names

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy load when possible**: Don't import expensive modules at startup
- **Dispose resources**: Always dispose of event listeners and subscriptions
- **Use async/await**: Prefer async patterns over Promise chains
- **Profile your changes**: Check performance impact of new features

## Debugging and Testing

### Debugging Techniques
1. **Use VS Code's debugger**: Set breakpoints in the VS Code you're developing
2. **Console logging**: Strategic `console.log()` statements can be invaluable
3. **Chrome DevTools**: For web-based components, use browser developer tools
4. **Extension Host debugging**: For extension-related issues, debug the extension host

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- --grep "MyFeature"

# Run integration tests
npm run test-integration

# Run linting
npm run eslint
```

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write a failing test that describes the expected behavior
2. Implement the minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Add more tests for edge cases

## Communication and Collaboration

### Working with Your Team
- **Ask questions early**: Don't struggle alone for hours
- **Document your learning**: Keep notes on complex systems you figure out
- **Share knowledge**: Help other interns and junior developers
- **Attend team meetings**: Participate actively in standups and planning

### GitHub Best Practices
- **Write clear issue descriptions**: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
- **Use proper labels**: Help maintainers categorize your contributions
- **Reference issues in commits**: Use "Fixes #12345" in commit messages
- **Be patient**: Reviews take time, especially in open source

### Communication Tips
- **Be specific**: "The terminal doesn't work" vs "Terminal crashes when running 'npm start' on Windows"
- **Provide context**: Include OS, VS Code version, and steps to reproduce
- **Stay professional**: Maintain a positive, collaborative tone
- **Follow up**: Don't let conversations die without resolution

## Learning and Growth

### Technical Skills to Develop
- **TypeScript/JavaScript mastery**: Understand advanced concepts like decorators, generics
- **Web technologies**: HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation, Web APIs
- **Electron**: Desktop app development with web technologies
- **Testing frameworks**: Mocha, Jest, and VS Code's testing infrastructure
- **Build systems**: Webpack, rollup, and VS Code's build pipeline

### Soft Skills to Practice
- **Problem decomposition**: Break large problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Code reading**: Spend time understanding existing code before writing new code
- **Documentation**: Write clear README files and inline comments
- **Time management**: Balance learning, coding, and collaboration effectively

### Learning Resources
- **VS Code Wiki**: Comprehensive documentation on architecture and processes
- **TypeScript Handbook**: Master the language used throughout the codebase
- **Electron Documentation**: Understand the desktop app framework
- **Node.js Documentation**: Learn the runtime environment
- **Git Documentation**: Become proficient with version control

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Mistakes
- **Ignoring the layer architecture**: Don't import workbench code in platform layers
- **Not disposing resources**: Always clean up event listeners and subscriptions
- **Blocking the main thread**: Use async operations for expensive computations
- **Hardcoding values**: Use configuration or constants instead
- **Skipping tests**: Every PR should include appropriate tests

### Process Mistakes
- **Working on main branch**: Always create feature branches
- **Large, monolithic PRs**: Break changes into smaller, reviewable chunks
- **Inadequate commit messages**: Write descriptive commit messages
- **Not updating documentation**: Update relevant docs when changing behavior
- **Ignoring CI failures**: Fix broken builds immediately

### Collaboration Mistakes
- **Not communicating blockers**: Speak up when you're stuck
- **Taking feedback personally**: View code review as learning, not criticism
- **Not asking for help**: Everyone needs guidance, especially as an intern
- **Perfectionism**: Done is often better than perfect for first iterations
