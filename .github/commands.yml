            comment: "We try to keep VS Code lean and we think the functionality you're asking for is great for a VS Code extension. Maybe you can already find one that suits your in the [VS Code Marketplace](https://aka.ms/vscodemarketplace). Just in case, in a few simple steps you can get started [writing your own extension](https://aka.ms/vscodewritingextensions).

If you wonder what we are up to, please see our [roadmap](https://aka.ms/vscoderoadmap).
