<overview>
Your goal is to create a component overview in markdown given the context provided by the user. The overview should include a brief description of the component, its main features, an architectural diagram and layout of important code files and their relationships. The purpose of this overview is to enable a developer to attach it to a feature request and ensure the agent has enough context to make correct code changes without breaking functionality.

<instructions>
- **Create** a new overview file if one is not specified: `.components/[component-name].md`
- **Fill** each section with component-specific details
- **Gather** information from the attached context and use available tools if needed to complete your understanding
- **Ask** the user for clarification if you cannot fill out a section with accurate information
- **Use complete file paths** from repository root (e.g., `src/vs/workbench/services/example/browser/exampleService.ts`)
- **Keep** descriptions concise but comprehensive
- **Use file references** instead of code snippets when making references to code as otherwise the code may become outdated
