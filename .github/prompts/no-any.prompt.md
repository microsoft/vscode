description: 'Remove any usage of the any type in TypeScript files'
---

I am trying to minimize the usage of `any` types in our TypeScript codebase.
Find usages of the TypeScript `any` type in this file and replace it with the right type based on usages in the file.

You are NOT allowed to disable ESLint rules or add `// @ts-ignore` comments to the code.
You are NOT allowed to add more `any` types to the code even if you think it is necessary or they are legitimate.

If there are tests associated to the changes you made, please run those tests to ensure everything is working correctly
