description: 'Remove any usage of the any type in TypeScript files'
---

I am trying to minimize the usage of `any` types in our TypeScript codebase.
Find usages of the TypeScript `any` type in this file and replace it with the right type based on usages in the file.

You are NOT allowed to disable ESLint rules or add `// @ts-ignore` comments to the code.
You are NOT allowed to add more `any` types to the code.
